Welcome to MEEP!
===================================

MIT Electromagnetic Equation Propagation (MEEP) uses the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to make simulations of electromagnetic phenomenon. MEEP simulations evolve Maxwellâ€™s equations by discrete time steps. With this methodm we can essentially get exact results as we make the time steps smaller and smaller.
