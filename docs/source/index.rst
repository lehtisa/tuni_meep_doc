Welcome to Meep!
===================================

MIT Electromagnetic Equation Propagation (Meep) uses the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to make simulations of electromagnetic phenomenon. Meep simulations evolve Maxwell’s equations by discrete time steps. With this methodm we can essentially get exact results as we make the time steps smaller and smaller.

This Quick Start Guide was made as a part of a physics project work course at Tampere University starting in late 2024. This documentation may get updated later in the future. This Quick Start Guide is based on the offcial Meep documentation `available here <https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
