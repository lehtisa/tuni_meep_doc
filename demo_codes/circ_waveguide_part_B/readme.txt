This directory should include 4 files and 2 directories:

-circ_waveguide_part_B (directory)
    - circ_waveguide_part_B.py (file)
    - readme.txt (this file)
    - sim_params.py (file)
    - visualize.py (file)
    - gds_files (directory)
    - results (directory)

Steps to run the simulation:
    1. Open the file sim_params.py and confirm the simulation 
       parameters are what you want
    2. Run the Python file circ_waveguide_part_B.py for example
       by the command: python circ_waveguide_part_B.py
    3. Make the figures by running the Python file visualize.py
       for example by the command: python visualize.py
